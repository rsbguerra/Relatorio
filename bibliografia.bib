abstract = {A hybrid approach for fast occlusion processing in computer-generated hologram calculation is studied in this paper. The proposed method is based on the combination of two commonly used approaches that complement one another: the point-source and wave-field approaches. By using these two approaches together, the proposed method thus takes advantage of both of them. In this method, the 3D scene is first sliced into several depth layers parallel to the hologram plane. Light scattered by the scene is then propagated and shielded from one layer to another using either a point-source or a wave-field approach according to a threshold criterion on the number of points within the layer. Finally, the hologram is obtained by computing the propagation of light from the nearest layer to the hologram plane. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method does not produce any visible artifact and outperforms both the point-source and wave-field approaches.},

@book{scavenging,
	abstract = {The vast reduction in size and power consumption of CMOS circuitry has led to a large research effort based around the vision of ubiquitous networks of wireless communication nodes. The wireless devices are usually designed to run on batteries. However, as the networks increase in number and the devices decrease in size, the replacement of depleted batteries is not practical. Furthermore, a battery that is large enough to last the lifetime of the device would dominate the overall system size, and thus is not very attractive. There is clearly a need to explore alternative methods of powering these small communication nodes. This book, therefore, focuses on potential "ambient" sources of power that can be scavenged or harvested and subsequently used to run low power electronics and wireless transceivers. A wide range of potential power sources are briefly explored. Based on a comparison of these many potential sources, commonly occurring vibrations was chosen as an attractive, and little explored, power source. Models for different types of power converters using both electrostatic and piezoelectric conversion mechanisms have been developed. The models have been validated by testing prototypes driven at vibrations similar to those found in many industrial and commercial building environments. Finally, integration of a piezoelectric generator, power circuit, and custom design radio transceiver is demonstrated. Power sources are becoming a bottleneck to the widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks. This work reviews many potential alternative sources of ambient power that can be scavenged. Vibration to electricity converters are explored in great detail, and based on studies and experiments, are shown to be an attractive power source in many applications.},
