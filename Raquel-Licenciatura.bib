abstract = {Digital holography is a growing field that owes its success to the provided three-dimensional imaging representation. This is achieved by encoding the wave field transmitted or scattered by an object in the form of an interference pattern with a reference beam. While in conventional imaging systems it is usually impossible to recover the correct focused image from a defocused one, with digital holography the image can be numerically retrieved at any distance from the hologram. Digital holography also allows the reconstruction of multiple objects at different depths.{\textless}p{\textgreater}  {\textless}/p{\textgreater} The complex object field at the hologram plane can be separated on real and imaginary, or amplitude and phase components for further compression. It could be inferred that more inter-component redundancies exist in real and imaginary information than in the amplitude and phase information. Also, several compression schemes, like lossless compression, lossy compression, based on subsampling, quantization, and transformation, mainly using wavelets were considered. The benchmark of the main available image coding standard solutions like JPEG, JPEG 2000, and the intra coding modes available on MPEG-2, H264/AVC and HEVC video codecs were also analyzed for digital holographic data compression on the hologram plane.{\textless}p{\textgreater}  {\textless}/p{\textgreater} In the current work, the benchmark of the main available image coding standard solutions JPEG, JPEG-XT, JPEG 2000 and the intra mode of HEVC, are performed for digital holographic data represented on the object plane, instead of the hologram plane. This study considers Real-Imaginary and Amplitude-Phase representations. As expected Real, Imaginary and Amplitude information present very similar compression performance and are coded very efficiently with the different standards. However, the phase information requires much higher bitrates (3/4 bpp more) to reach similar quality levels. Moreover, the Amplitude information results in slightly larger bitrates for the same quality level than real or imaginary information.{\textless}p{\textgreater}  {\textless}/p{\textgreater} Comparing the different standards, the HEVC intra main coding profile is a very efficient model and outperforms the other standards. Furthermore, JPEG 2000 results in very similar compression performance. A comparison with studies where coding was performed on the hologram plane will reveal the advantages of coding on the object plane. Hence, becomes evident that future representation standards should consider the representation of digital holograms on the object plane instead of the hologram plane.},

abstract = {JPEG2000: Image Compression Fundamentals, Standards and Practice is an essential reference for professional engineers and academic researchers in the fields of communication, image processing, signal processing, information theory, and multimedia. It has specific applications for those involved in the development of software and hardware solutions for multimedia, internet, and medical imaging applications, and for those pursuing research in image and video compression. The book is suitable as a primary text for a course in image compression; it would also be helpful in the context of a more general class covering multimedia compression at an in-depth level. Final year engineering undergraduate students pursuing projects in multimedia compression and/or communication would also find the book a useful tool. JPEG2000: Image Compression Fundamentals, Standards and Practice is written in four parts, to serve the interests of a wide readership. Representing about half the total text, Part I of the book provides a thorough and up-to-date background in the fundamentals of image compression, including topics not previously brought together in a single volume. Part 2 contains a complete description of the JPEG2000 standard. This description is written in such a way as to be completely self-contained from an implementation perspective, while it contains numerous references to the fundamental developments in Part 1. Together, Parts 1 and 2 serve the complementary roles of explanation and exposition in relation to both the JPEG2000 standard and modern image compression techniques. Part 3 of the book is devoted to the implementation and exploitation of the JPEG2000 standard, containing guidelines, suggestions, and analyses for both software and hardware oriented applications. Part 4 describes other key image compression standards, namely JPEG and JPEG-LS. The purpose of this material is to allow the reader to compare the capabilities and complexity associated with these standards with those of JPEG2000. This final part of the book also serves to provide a practical demonstration of some of the fundamental techniques introduced in Part 1 which are not demonstrated by the JPEG2000 standard.},

abstract = {Holography allows for both the recording and reproduction of wavefields of light, and is thereby able to fully capture the three-dimensional structure of objects. The appearance of the object will change according to the position and orientation of the viewer, providing an immersive experience as if objects are actually present. Moreover, holograms have many applications in metrology such as microscopy and interferometry. Because holograms represent interference patterns, they possess significantly different signal properties from natural photography and video; this will make conventional image encoders perform sub-optimally on holograms. Therefore, new data compression techniques have to be evaluated for this type of data. One important requirement for comparing and evaluating various codecs is to have reference holograms which are publicly available. For this purpose, we have set up an open public database containing a set of computer-generated holograms. Furthermore, we evaluate the performances of two JPEG 2000-based coders, which were modified to better cope with holographic data.},

abstract = {The angular spectrum representation is a mathematical technique to describe optical fields in homogeneous media. Optical fields are described as a superposition of plane waves and evanescent waves which are physically intuitive solutions of Maxwell's equations. The angular spectrum representation is found to be a very powerful method for the description of laser beam propagation and light focusing. Furthermore, in the paraxial limit, the angular spectrum representation becomes identical with the framework of Fourier optics which extends its importance even further. In this chapter we will consider purely monochromatic fields of angular frequency $\omega$, which can be represented as complex fields E(r) according to (c.f. Chapter 2) E(r, t) = Re{\{}E(r) e −i$\omega$t {\}}. (7.1) In situations where the field is not time-harmonic, we simply replace the complex field E(r) by the spectrumˆEspectrumˆ spectrumˆE(r, $\omega$) and obtain the time-dependent field by Fourier transformation (see Section 2.2). By the angular spectrum representation we understand the series expansion of an arbitrary field in terms of plane (and evanescent) waves with variable amplitudes and propagation directions (see Section 2.1.3). Assume we know the electric field E(r) at any point r = (x, y, z) in space. For example, E(r) can be the solution of an optical scattering problem, as shown in Fig. 7.1, for which E = E inc + E scatt. In the angular spectrum picture, we draw an arbitrary axis z and consider the field E 97},

@techreport{Pierre-AnthonyLemieux,
abstract = {Executive Summary High Throughput JPEG 2000 (HTJ2K) is a new addition to the JPEG 2000 family of International Standards developed by JPEG Committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1). HTJ2K brings an order of magnitude increase in throughput to JPEG 2000: approximately 10x for moderate to higher compressed bit rates and more than 30x for lossless coding. HTJ2K software and GPU throughputs become comparable to, if not higher than, that achievable with the original, much less functional, JPEG algorithm. Low-cost, high throughput hardware implementations can also be realized. For example, full 4K 4:4:4 36-bit/channel video can be encoded to 2 bits/pixel at more than 90 fps and decoded at more than 140 fps on a 3.4GHz 4-core Skylake desktop processor, while a mid-range GTX1080 GPU can decode the same content at around 500 fps. HTJ2K achieves these improvements by introducing a new HT block coder, which is a drop-in replacement for the original JPEG 2000 Part 1 block coder (J2K-1) and allows truly reversible transcoding to/from J2K-1. HTJ2K preserves all features of JPEG 2000 Part 1 apart from quality scalability. It is compatible with the extensions defined by JPEG 2000 Part 2, the interactive communication protocols defined by JPEG 2000 Part 9, and other parts of the JPEG 2000 family. It fully supports resolution scalability, efficient spatial random access, multi-spectral and hyper-spectral content, and high throughput non-iterative precise rate control. It retains high coding efficiency from lossless all the way down to bit rates on the order of 0.5 bits/pixel. Unlike J2K-1, the HT coder is not fully embedded and hence quality scalability is largely sacrificed. HTJ2K codestreams can however preserve quality layer boundaries enabling truly reversible transcoding between HT and J2K-1. HTJ2K addresses the needs of professional video capture, editing, streaming and contribution markets, including high throughput lossless coding of high precision and half-float content. HTJ2K simultaneously addresses a broad range of applications from point-to-point streaming to extremely efficient image capture, preview and browsing. At the same time, high energy efficiency makes it an excellent candidate for mobile and satellite imaging applications. Finally, the accompanying JPH file format updates JPEG 2000 formats with modern colour space support, supporting HDR content with almost unlimited precision, while also allowing for the representation of raw colour sensor data with custom colour filter array patterns. Like JPEG 2000 Part 1, the HTJ2K standard is intended to be royalty free 1.

abstract = {The subject of this paper is a new two-step method of optical imagery. In a first step the object is illuminated with a coherent monochromatic wave, and the diffraction pattern resulting from the interference of the coherent secondary wave issuing from the object with the strong, coherent background is recorded on a photographic plate. If the photographic plate, suitably processed, is replaced in the original position and illuminated with the coherent background alone, an image of the object will appear behind it, in the original position. It is shown that this process reconstructs the coherent secondary wave, together with an equally strong ‘twin wave' which has the same amplitude, but opposite phase shifts relative to the background. The illuminating wave itself can be used for producing the coherent background. The simplest case is illumination by a point source. In this case the two twin waves are shown to correspond to two ‘twin objects', one of which is the original, while the other is its mirror image with respect to the illuminating centre. A physical aperture can be used as a point source, or the image of an aperture produced by a condenser system . If this system has aberrations, such as astigmatism or spherical aberration, the twin image will be no longer sharp but will appear blurred, as if viewed through a system with twice the aberrations of the condenser. In either case the correct image of the object can be effectively isolated from its twin, and separately observed. Three-dimensional objects can be reconstructed, as well as two-dimensional. The wave used in the reconstruction need not be the original, it can be, for example, a light-optical imitation of the electron wave with which the diffraction diagram was taken. Thus it becomes possible to extend the idea of Sir Lawrence Bragg's ‘X -ray microscope' to arbitrary objects, and use the new method for improvements in electron microscopy. The apparatus will consist of two parts, an electronic device in which a diffraction pattern is taken with electrons diverging from a fine focus, and an optical synthetizer, which imitates the essential data of the electronic device on a much enlarged scale. The theory of the analysis-synthesis cycle is developed, with a discussion of the impurities arising in the reconstruction, and their avoidance. The limitations of the new method are due chiefly to the small intensities which are available in coherent beams, but it appears perfectly feasible to achieve a resolution limit of 1 {\AA}, ultimately perhaps even better.},

abstract = {Holography is an emerging technology to represent and display visual information and the associated experience expectations on the layman imaginary are huge. A hologram is a reproduction of a light field represented through the interference pattern between two wavefields, the reference and object wavefields. Holograms may be optically generated from real objects or computationally generated from synthetic objects leading to the so-called computer generated holograms. Whatever the creation process, holograms may have a digital representation using some appropriate representation format. Moreover, considering the huge amounts of data involved, digital holographic data has to be compressed using appropriate coding solutions, possibly available standard coding solutions. Finally, the decoded holographic data has to lead to reconstructed images using some appropriate reconstruction method. Holographic data coding is an emerging field of research where literature is still very scarce. In this context, before starting designing coding solutions considering the specific characteristics of holographic data, it is essential to assess the current compression performance associated to the most relevant available standard coding solutions and alternative representations formats. This paper has the main objective to benchmark the most relevant available standard coding solutions and the main alternative representation formats under meaningful test conditions and for the test material currently available. This assessment is critical to understand the current status quo and launch future research.},

abstract = {Digital hologram sequences have great potential for the recording of 3D scenes of moving macroscopic objects as their numerical reconstruction can yield a range of perspective views of the scene. Digital holograms inherently have large information content and lossless coding of holographic data is rather inefficient due to the speckled nature of the interference fringes they contain. Lossy coding of still holograms and hologram sequences has shown promising results. By definition, lossy compression introduces errors in the reconstruction. In all of the previous studies, numerical metrics were used to measure the compression error and through it, the coding quality. Digital hologram reconstructions are highly speckled and the speckle pattern is very sensitive to data changes. Hence, numerical quality metrics can be misleading. For example, for low compression ratios, a numerically significant coding error can have visually negligible effects. Yet, in several cases, it is of high interest to know how much lossy compression can be achieved, while maintaining the reconstruction quality at visually lossless levels. Using an experimental threshold estimation method, the staircase algorithm, we determined the highest compression ratio that was not perceptible to human observers for objects compressed with Dirac and MPEG- 4 compression methods. This level of compression can be regarded as the point below which compression is perceptually lossless although physically the compression is lossy. It was found that up to 4 to 7.5 fold compression can be obtained with the above methods without any perceptible change in the appearance of video sequences.},

We also derive new asymptotic error formula? that exhibit bound constants that are proportional to the magnitude of the first nonvanishing moment of the wavelet. The Daubechies 9/7 stands out because it is very close to orthonormal, but this turns out to be slightly detrimental to its asymptotic performance when compared to other wavelets with four vanishing moments.},

@article{Bernardo2018a,
abstract = {Digital holography allows the recording, storage and subsequent reconstruction of both amplitude and phase of the light field scattered by an object. This is accomplished by recording interference patterns that preserve the properties of the original object field essential for 3D visualization, the so-called holograms. Digital holography refers to the acquisition of holograms with a digital sensor, typically a CCD or a CMOS camera, and to the reconstruction of the 3D object field using numerical methods. In the current work, the different representations of digital holographic information in the hologram and in the object planes are studied. The coding performance of the different complex field representations, notably Amplitude-Phase and Real-Imaginary, in both the hologram plane and the object plane, is assessed using both computer generated and experimental holograms. The HEVC intra main coding profile is used for the compression of the different representations in both planes, either for experimental holograms or computer generated holograms. The HEVC intra compression in the object plane outperforms encoding in the hologram plane. Furthermore, encoding computer generated holograms in the object plane has a larger benefit than the same encoding over the experimental holograms. This difference was expected, since experimental holograms are affected by a larger negative influence of speckle noise, resulting in a loss of compression efficiency. This work emphasizes the possibility of holographic coding on the object plane, instead of the common encoding in the hologram plane approach. Moreover, this possibility allows direct visualization of the Object Plane Amplitude in a regular 2D display without any transformation methods. The complementary phase information can easily be used to render 3D features such as depth map, multi-view or even holographic interference patterns for further 3D visualization depending on the display technology.},

We find that the best lossless (Lempel-Ziv, Lempel-Ziv-Welch, Huffman, Burrows-Wheeler) compression rates can be expected when the digital hologram is stored in an intermediate coding of separate data streams for real and imaginary components. The lossy techniques are based on subsampling, quantization, and discrete Fourier transformation. For various degrees of speckle reduction, we quantify the number of Fourier coefficients that can be removed from the hologram domain, and the lowest level of quantization achievable, without incurring significant loss in correlation performance or significant error in the reconstructed object domain.},

abstract = {For compression of digital holographic data, choosing an appropriate representation of the holographic information is always a main target. The effectiveness of the representation needs to be studied before applying further compression method for reducing storage and transmission burden. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using amplitude-phase information of the complex object wave and the difference information between different phase-shifted holograms by scalar and vector quantization. The experiments show that the amplitude-phase representation is more suited when applying intra compression, whereas holograms are more suited for inter compression. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

@techreport{Arrifano,
abstract = {Holography is deemed the ultimate 3D [1]. Holographic displays provide full eye accommodation, thus not causing eye strain or headaches which are an inconvenient side-effect of 3D stereo [2][3]. As the etymological meaning of Hologra-phy suggests, digital holograms store full 3D information of the recorded object (including multiple views). For that reason , storage and transmission of digital holographic video requires high bandwidth. Considering that current high-speed communication cables cannot provide enough bandwidth for the realtime transmission of holographic video, it is not unre-alistic to assume that in the future the transmission of realtime holographic video might require more than one transmission channel. In that case, one can take advantage of multiple description coding (MDC) for optimally coding data between available channels and mitigate channel errors. We present a MDC solution for transmission of holo-graphic video from a computer host to a holographic display device using two transmission channels. To our knowledge, there are no reports of previous works regarding the MDC of digital holograms. Because digital holograms are inherently different from regular images [4], the proposed work is novel on its own. Furthermore, since the holographic format is a direct result of the physical phenomena, the holographic format will not change in the future; allowing the presented work to be a contribution for future holographic displaying technology.},
